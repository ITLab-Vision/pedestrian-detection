# Pedestrian detection benchmark

## What is it
ITLab-Vision pedestrian detection benchmark has been created to compare the state-of-the-art pedestrian detection approaches. To be exact the benchmark oriented to deep learning methods.

## Where the training and testing data
We implement the methods that described in [Caltech Pedestrian Detection Benchmark](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/CaltechPedestrians/) and we use the training and testing data that are stored in this benchmark.
